# DevOps
DevOps isÂ a methodology that aims to bring together developers and operations to speed up the deployment process.

Here, I'm uploading my DevOps notes with projects for each tool. You'll get commands to install and operate the packages.

Read, Practise and Enjoy DevOps. If have any queries related to notes then feel free to msg me on LinkedIn. 

Thank you!!!
